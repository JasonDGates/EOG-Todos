# Todo List App

A simple React Todo List application built using **TypeScript** and basic **CSS** for styling. This app demonstrates the use of React's local state for managing a list of tasks. It allows users to add and delete todos in a clean and minimal UI.

## Why TypeScript?

The original codebox provided was built without TypeScript, but since the position requires TypeScript expertise, I decided to rebuild the project using **TypeScript** to showcase my skills and familiarity with it.

## Features

- Add new todos with ease.
- Remove todos to keep your list clean.
- Responsive and modern UI with basic CSS for styling.
